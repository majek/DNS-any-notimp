     Standard way for Authoratitive DNS servers to refuse ANY query
                      draft-ogud-dnsop-any-notimp

Abstract

   DNS ANY query is widely abused for DDoS attacks.  This feature was
   designed to aid in debugging.  As there is no good reason for
   applications to ever issue an ANY query this document codifies how an
   authoritative server can reject such queries.

1.  Introduction

   DNS is an evolving protocol, at glacial phase, this document
   specifies how an Authorative server can reject an ANY query.  ANY
   queries are widely abused by DDoS attackers as they return the
   largest answers.  Over the years a number of attempts have been made
   to throttle ANY queries, ranging from returning TC bit to all UDP ANY
   queries, blocking them totally, and QoS'ing the number of ANY queires
   accepted per second.  All of those are band-aids.

   Some modern Authoritative servers such as those used by CDN's do not
   have have DNS zones, but know which source to fetch the data from,
   for those servers answering ANY query truthfully is hard work.  Thus
   not even trying makes life better.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol change

   An Authorative DNS[RFC1035] server can reject ANY query by returning
   RCODE = 4 (NOTIMP).

   A Recurisive Resolver SHOULD ignore RD bit set on ANY query.
   Additionaly as Recursive Resolver SHOULD remember that ANY queries
   are not available from upstream Auth server, this SHOULD be cached
   for at least 5 minutes.

4.  IANA considerations

   No IANA action is requested

5.  Security considerations

   ANY query is mainly used for attacks on the internet due to its
   amplification factor.  Codifying this behavior makes life harder for
   attackers, at minimal cost for DNS operators.

6.  Internationalizaiton Considerations

   NONE

7.  Implementation Experience

   TBD
